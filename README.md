# LotteryDraw

install MongoDB https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#enterprise and runit (mongodb, mongo)

Fire up the service using visual studio cassini and it should work

Can test the service using the swagger end point
http://localhost:50162/swagger/ui/index

Wasn't able to finish the front end in a timely fashion and would have spent too much time on it.
